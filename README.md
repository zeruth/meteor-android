# Requirements  

Android 11 R device

# Building  

Get latest Android Studio / NDK  
Execute bundled run configuration 'Inject' at clone and when modifying api/api-rs/deob/mixins  
You can now build the 'app' module  

# Info  
The game should be fully playable now, with no input related issues preventing gameplay.  
- Please create an issue if you find any!
  
You should be able to rotate the camera via viewport drag, long press to open menu, tap to click, organize inventory / bank, and use sliders / buttons

You should be able to open the keyboard at any time via the keyboard button on the toolbar and close it by pressing enter  
  
Currently the game renders at 50fps in the Android Emulator and on my personal S24 Ultra.  
Performance has not been tested on other devices.  
  
Please create a rendering issue ONLY if your phone has problems drawing the game, and only if one does not exist
